Headlights adds a 'Bundles' menu to Vim, revealing your bundles (aka. plugins) and the features they provide.

Headlights creates a menu for each _currently loaded_ bundle, grouping together docs, commands, mappings, abbreviations, functions, highlights, and plugin files.

Combined with a powerful bundle manager, Headlights will improve your Vim user experience -- nay, your quality of life.
