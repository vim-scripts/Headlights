Headlights is a Vim plugin that creates a TextMate like Bundles menu.

Headlights sheds light on what plugins are installed and how to use them. It creates a menu for each plugin, scraping together docs, commands, mappings, abbreviations, functions, and script files.

Combined with a powerful bundle manager like Vundle, Headlights will improve your Vim user experience.
